	<h3>Documentation and examples for adding custom Bootstrap tooltips with CSS and JavaScript using CSS3 for animations and data-attributes for local title storage.</h3>

	<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The tooltip plugin generates content and markup on demand, and by default places tooltips after their trigger element.</p>

<h3>Markup</h3>
<p>The required markup for a tooltip is only a data attribute and title on the HTML element you wish to have a tooltip. The generated markup of a tooltip is rather simple, though it does require a position (by default, set to top by the plugin).</p>

<h3>Disabled elements</h3>
<p>Elements with the disabled attribute aren’t interactive, meaning users cannot focus, hover, or click them to trigger a tooltip (or popover). As a workaround, you’ll want to trigger the tooltip from a wrapper div or span, ideally made keyboard-focusable using tabindex="0", and override the pointer-events on the disabled element.span</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to data-, as in data-animation="".</p>
