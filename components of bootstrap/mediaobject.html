	<h1>Media object</h1>
	<h3>Documentation and examples for Bootstrap’s media object to construct highly repetitive components like blog comments, tweets, and the like.</h3>
	<p>The media object helps build complex and repetitive components where some media is positioned alongside content that doesn’t wrap around said media. Plus, it does this with only two required classes thanks to flexbox.

Below is an example of a single media object. Only two classes are required—the wrapping .media and the .media-body around your content. Optional padding and margin can be controlled through spacing utilities.</p>

<h3>Nesting</h3>
<p>Media objects can be infinitely nested, though we suggest you stop at some point. Place nested .media within the .media-body of a parent media object.</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>Media in a media object can be aligned with flexbox utilities to the top (default), middle, or end of your .media-body content.</p>

<h3>Order</h3>
<p>Change the order of content in media objects by modifying the HTML itself, or by adding some custom flexbox CSS to set the order property (to an integer of your choosing).</p>

<h3>Media list<h3>
<p>Because the media object has so few structural requirements, you can also use these classes on list HTML elements. On your ul or ol, add the .list-unstyled to remove any browser default list styles, and then apply .media to your lis. As always, use spacing utilities wherever needed to fine tune.</p>
