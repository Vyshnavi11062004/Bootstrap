	<h1>Nav Bar</h1>
	<h3>Documentation and examples for Bootstrap’s powerful, responsive navigation header, the navbar. Includes support for branding, navigation, and more, including support for our collapse plugin.</h3>
	<h3>Brand</h3>
<p>The .navbar-brand can be applied to most elements, but an anchor works best as some elements might require utility classes or custom styles.</p>

<h3>Nav</h3>
<p>Navbar navigation links build on our .nav options with their own modifier class and require the use of toggler classes for proper responsive styling. Navigation in navbars will also grow to occupy as much horizontal space as possible to keep your navbar contents securely aligned.

Active states—with .active—to indicate the current page can be applied directly to .nav-links or their immediate parent .nav-items.</p>

<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>Place various form controls and components within a navbar with .form-inline.</p>

<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Navbars may contain bits of text with the help of .navbar-text. This class adjusts vertical alignment and horizontal spacing for strings of text.</p>

<h3>Color schemes</h3>
<p>Theming the navbar has never been easier thanks to the combination of theming classes and background-color utilities. Choose from .navbar-light for use with light background colors, or .navbar-dark for dark background colors. Then, customize with .bg-* utilities.</p>

<h3>Containers</h3>
<p>Although it’s not required, you can wrap a navbar in a .container to center it on a page or add one within to only center the contents of a fixed or static top navbar.</p>

<h3>Placement</h3>
<p>Use our position utilities to place navbars in non-static positions. Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed navbars use position: fixed, meaning they’re pulled from the normal flow of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., padding-top on the body) to prevent overlap with other elements.</p>
