<h1>Forms</h1>
<h3>Examples and usage guidelines for form control styles, layout options, and custom components for creating a wide variety of forms.</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Bootstrap’s form controls expand on our Rebooted form styles with classes. Use these classes to opt into their customized displays for a more consistent rendering across browsers and devices.

Be sure to use an appropriate type attribute on all inputs (e.g., email for email address or number for numerical information) to take advantage of newer input controls like email verification, number selection, and more.

Here’s a quick example to demonstrate Bootstrap’s form styles. Keep reading for documentation on required classes, form layout, and more.</p>

<h3>Form controls</h3>
<p>Textual form controls—like inputs, selects, and textareas—are styled with the .form-control class. Included are styles for general appearance, focus state, sizing, and more.

Be sure to explore our custom forms to further style selects.</p>

<h3>Sizing</h3>
<p>Set heights using classes like .form-control-lg and .form-control-sm.</p>

<h3>Range Inputs</h3>
<p>Set horizontally scrollable range inputs using .form-control-range.</p>


<h3>Checkboxes and radios</h3>
<p>Default checkboxes and radios are improved upon with the help of .form-check, a single class for both input types that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements. Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.

Disabled checkboxes and radios are supported. The disabled attribute will apply a lighter color to help indicate the input’s state.

Checkboxes and radios use are built to support HTML-based form validation and provide concise, accessible labels. As such, our inputs and labels are sibling elements as opposed to an input within a label. This is slightly more verbose as you must specify id and for attributes to relate the input and label.</p>

<h3>Default (stacked)</h3>
<p>By default, any number of checkboxes and radios that are immediate sibling will be vertically stacked and appropriately spaced with .form-check.</p>
