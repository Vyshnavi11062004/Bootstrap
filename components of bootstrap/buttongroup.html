	<h1>Button Group</h1>
	<h3>Group a series of buttons together on a single line with the button group, and super-power them with JavaScript.</h3>
	<h3>Basic example</h3>
<p>Wrap a series of buttons with .btn in .btn-group. Add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with our buttons plugin.</p>
<h3>Button toolbar</h3>
<p>Combine sets of button groups into button toolbars for more complex components. Use utility classes as needed to space out groups, buttons, and more.</p>

<h3>Sizing</h3>
<p>Instead of applying button sizing classes to every button in a group, just add .btn-group-* to each .btn-group, including each one when nesting multiple groups.</p>

<h3>Nesting</h3>
<p>Place a .btn-group within another .btn-group when you want dropdown menus mixed with a series of buttons.</p>

<h3>Vertical variation</h3>
<p>Make a set of buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally. Split button dropdowns are not supported here.</p>
