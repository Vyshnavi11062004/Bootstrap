	<h1>Alerts</h1>
	<h3>Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.</h3>
	<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use the alerts jQuery plugin.</p>
<h3>Conveying meaning to assistive technologies</h3>
<p>Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .sr-only class.</p>

<h3>Link color</h3>
<p>Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.</p>

<h3>Additional content</h3>
<p>Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.</p>
