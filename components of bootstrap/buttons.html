<h1>Buttons</h1>
<h3>Use Bootstrap’s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.</h3>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.</p>

<h4>Conveying meaning to assistive technologies</h4>
<p>Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .sr-only class.</p>

<h4>Button tags</h4>
<p>The .btn classes are designed to be used with the button element. However, you can also use these classes on a or input elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).</p>

<p>When using button classes on a elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

<h4>Outline buttons</h4>
<p>In need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring? Replace the default modifier classes with the .btn-outline-* ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.</p>

<h4>Sizes</h4>
<p>Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Add .btn-lg or .btn-sm for additional sizes.</p>

<h4>Active state</h4>
<p>Buttons will appear pressed (with a darker background, darker border, and inset shadow) when active. There’s no need to add a class to buttons as they use a pseudo-class. However, you can still force the same active appearance with .active (and include the aria-pressed="true" attribute) should you need to replicate the state programmatically.</p>

	<h4>Disabled state</h4>
<p>Make buttons look inactive by adding the disabled boolean attribute to any button element.</p>

	<h4>Button plugin</h4>
<p>Do more with buttons. Control button states or create groups of buttons for more components like toolbars.</p>

<h4>Toggle states</h4>
<p>Add data-toggle="button" to toggle a button’s active state. If you’re pre-toggling a button, you must manually add the .active class and aria-pressed="true" to the button</p>


<h4>Checkbox and radio buttons</h4>
<p>Bootstrap’s .button styles can be applied to other elements, such as labels, to provide checkbox or radio style button toggling. Add data-toggle="buttons" to a .btn-group containing those modified buttons to enable their toggling behavior via JavaScript and add .btn-group-toggle to style the inputs within your buttons. Note that you can create single input-powered buttons or groups of them.</p>

<p>The checked state for these buttons is only updated via click event on the button. If you use another method to update the input—e.g., with input type="reset" or by manually applying the input’s checked property—you’ll need to toggle .active on the label manually.</p>

<p>Note that pre-checked buttons require you to manually add the .active class to the input’s label.</p>
