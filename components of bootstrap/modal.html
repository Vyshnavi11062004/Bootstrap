	<h1>Modal</h1>
	<h3>Use Bootstrap’s JavaScript modal plugin to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.</h3>

	<h3>Modal components</h3>
<p>Below is a static modal example (meaning its position and display have been overridden). Included are the modal header, modal body (required for padding), and modal footer (optional). We ask that you include modal headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide another explicit dismiss action.</p>

<h3>Live demo</h3>
<p>Toggle a working modal demo by clicking the button below. It will slide down and fade in from the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Scrolling long content</h3>
<p>When modals become too long for the user’s viewport or device, they scroll independent of the page itself. Try the demo below to see what we mean.</p>


<h3>Vertically centered</h3>
<p>Add .modal-dialog-centered to .modal-dialog to vertically center the modal.</p>

<h3>Tooltips and popovers</h3>
<p>Tooltips and popovers can be placed within modals as needed. When modals are closed, any tooltips and popovers within are also automatically dismissed.</p>

<h3>Using the grid</h3>
<p>Utilize the Bootstrap grid system within a modal by nesting .container-fluid within the .modal-body. Then, use the normal grid system classes as you would anywhere else.</p>


<h3>Varying modal content</h3>
<p>Have a bunch of buttons that all trigger the same modal with slightly different contents? Use event.relatedTarget and HTML data-* attributes (possibly via jQuery) to vary the contents of the modal depending on which button was clicked.

Below is a live demo followed by example HTML and JavaScript. For more information, read the modal events docs for details on relatedTarget.</p>
