<h1>List group</h1>
<h3>List groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of content. Modify and extend them to support just about any content within.</h3>
<h4>Active items</h4>
<p>Add .active to a .list-group-item to indicate the current active selection.</p>
<h4>Disabled items</h4>
<p>Add .disabled to a .list-group-item to make it appear disabled. Note that some elements with .disabled will also require custom JavaScript to fully disable their click events (e.g., links).</p>
<h4>Links and buttons</h4>
<p>Use as or buttons to create actionable list group items with hover, disabled, and active states by adding .list-group-item-action. We separate these pseudo-classes to ensure list groups made of non-interactive elements (like lis or divs) don’t provide a click or tap affordance.</p>
	<h4>Flush</h4>
<p>Add .list-group-flush to remove some borders and rounded corners to render list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container (e.g., cards).</p>

<h4>Numbered</h4>
<p>Add the .list-group-numbered modifier class (and optionally use an ol element) to opt into numbered list group items. Numbers are generated via CSS (as opposed to a ols default browser styling) for better placement inside list group items and to allow for better customization.</p>

<p>Numbers are generated by counter-reset on the ol, and then styled and placed with a ::before pseudo-element on the li with counter-increment and content.</p>

	<h4>Horizontal</h4>
<p>Add .list-group-horizontal to change the layout of list group items from vertical to horizontal across all breakpoints. Alternatively, choose a responsive variant .list-group-horizontal-{sm|md|lg|xl|xxl} to make a list group horizontal starting at that breakpoint’s min-width. Currently horizontal list groups cannot be combined with flush list groups.

ProTip: Want equal-width list group items when horizontal? Add .flex-fill to each list group item.</p>

<h4>Contextual classes</h4>
<p>Use contextual classes to style list items with a stateful background and color.
Contextual classes also work with .list-group-item-action. Note the addition of the hover styles here not present in the previous example. Also supported is the .active state; apply it to indicate an active selection on a contextual list group item.</p>
<h4>Checkboxes and radios</h4>
<p>Place Bootstrap’s checkboxes and radios within list group items and customize as needed. You can use them without labels, but please remember to include an aria-label attribute and value for accessibility.</p>
