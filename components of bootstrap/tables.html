<h1>Tables</h1>
<h3>Documentation and examples for opt-in styling of tables (given their prevalent use in JavaScript plugins) with Bootstrap.</h3>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Due to the widespread use of tables across third-party widgets like calendars and date pickers, we’ve designed our tables to be opt-in. Just add the base class .table to any table, then extend with custom styles or our various included modifier classes.</p>

<p>Using the most basic table markup, here’s how .table-based tables look in Bootstrap. All table styles are inherited in Bootstrap 4, meaning any nested tables will be styled in the same manner as the parent.</p>

<h3>Striped rows</h3>
<p>Use .table-striped to add zebra-striping to any table row within the tbody</p>
<h3>Bordered table</h3>
<p>Add .table-bordered for borders on all sides of the table and cells.</p>

<h3>Borderless table</h3>
<p>Add .table-borderless for a table without borders.</p>

<h3>Hoverable rows</h3>
<p>Add .table-hover to enable a hover state on table rows within a tbody.</p>

<h3>Captions</h3>
<p>A caption functions like a heading for a table. It helps users with screen readers to find a table and understand what it’s about and decide if they want to read it.</p>

<h3>Responsive tables</h3>
<p>Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by wrapping a .table with .table-responsive. Or, pick a maximum breakpoint with which to have a responsive table up to by using .table-responsive{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl}.</p>

<h3>Vertical clipping/truncation</h3>
<p>Responsive tables make use of overflow-y: hidden, which clips off any content that goes beyond the bottom or top edges of the table. In particular, this can clip off dropdown menus and other third-party widgets.</p>

<h3>Always responsive</h3>
<p>Across every breakpoint, use .table-responsive for horizontally scrolling tables.</p>
