<h1>Spinners</h1>
<p>Indicate the loading state of a component or page with Bootstrap spinners, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript.</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>Bootstrap “spinners” can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with our amazing utility classes.
For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes role="status" and a nested span class="sr-only">Loading.../span.</p>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>The border spinner uses currentColor for its border-color, meaning you can customize the color with text color utilities. You can use any of our text color utilities on the standard spinner.</p>
<h2>Growing spinner</h2>
<p>If you don’t fancy a border spinner, switch to the grow spinner. While it doesn’t technically spin, it does repeatedly grow!</p>
